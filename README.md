# US_Delay_Flight
This project involves analyzing airline delay data obtained from Kaggle to identify key insights and demonstrate skills in Python, Excel, and Tableau. The primary focus is on understanding the causes of delays and showcasing data cleaning, analysis, and visualization capabilities.

Dataset Overview
Source:
  Kaggle Airline Delay Causes Dataset

Tools Used
Python (Google Colab):
  Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring proper data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Identifying trends in delays. 
  Visualizing key insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  Exporting cleaned data for further use.

Excel:
  Summarizing and verifying data calculations.

Tableau:
  Creating interactive dashboards to visualize delay trends and causes.
  
Key Steps

1. Data Cleaning (Python)
  Handled missing values by filling with appropriate statistics (e.g., zeros for delays).
  Removed duplicate records.
  Converted columns to their correct data types (e.g., year and month to integers).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
  Total Flights vs. Delayed Flights:
    Compared the proportion of delayed flights.

  Delays by Cause:
    Analyzed delays caused by carriers, weather, NAS, security, and late aircraft.

  Delays by Carrier and Airport:
    Identified top-performing and underperforming airlines and airports.

Delays by Month:
    Observed seasonal trends in delays.

3. Visualization (Tableau)
  Created dashboards to:
    Highlight delay causes.
    Display airline and airport performance.
    Showcase monthly and yearly trends.

How to Reproduce This Project
1. Clone the Repository
  git clone https://githubcom/your-username/airline-delay-analysis.git
  cd airline-delay-analysis

2. Open the Google Colab Notebook
  Open Airline_Delay_Analysis.ipynb in Google Colab.
  Follow the steps outlined in the notebook for data cleaning and analysis.

3. Use SQL for Further Analysis
  Load the cleaned dataset into your SQL environment.
  Run queries to explore further insights.

4. Tableau Visualization
  Use the exrted cleaned dataset (cleaned_airline_delay_data.csv) to build dashboards.
  Key Insights
  Delays by Cause:
    Carrier-related delays are the most frequent cause of flight disruptions.
    Weather delays are significant during certain months (e.g., winter).

  Top Airports:
    Some airports consistently experience higher delays due to traffic volume or weather conditions.

  Monthly Trends:
    Peak delays occur during holiday seasons and bad weather months.

Future Work
Use machine learning to predict delays based on weather and airline data.
Expand the analysis to include more datasets for international flights.
